# Week 1 Overview

Our first week consisted of the following (to be completed later):

-   Setting up the project and assigning tasks
-   Creating a Github Projects page for our tickets/tasks
-   Starting to work on our separate components' visually (some with dummy data etc)
-   Working together to align the skeleton template correctly (we did some research into using Grid and then Jennie implemented it for us)
-   Looking into the API calls (and getting stuck regarding Trafikverket's API)

# Week 2 Overview

In our second week, we focused on integrating functionality into our components, solving key issues, and collaborating on API implementation.

-   Integrated the OpenWeather API for weather data and worked through various authorization errors,
-   Troubleshooted issues where API keys were not recognized by the environment, leading to undefined or missing values,
-   Verified API keys and adjusting request URL formats,
-   Created environment variables in a .env file for storing sensitive API keys securely,
-   encountered challenges with the Trafikverket API for local transport data, requiring additional research on how to authenticate requests and parse complex data structures,
