# Week 1 Overview

Our first week consisted of the following (to be completed later):

- Setting up the project and assigning tasks
- Creating a Github Projects page for our tickets/tasks
- Starting to work on our separate components' visually (some with dummy data etc)
- Working together to align the skeleton template correctly (we did some research into using Grid and then Jennie implemented it for us)
- Looking into the API calls (and getting stuck regarding Trafikverket's API)
